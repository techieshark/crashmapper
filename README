# Crashmapper - Mapping crashes in Oregon

This was originally done as a coding project for a Functional Languages class at Portland State University.
Seems pretty useful though, so it is now available for general use.

## Requirements

The code was developed and tested with the following:

* 'pandoc' for creating documentation
* 'ghc' (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) 

## Contributors
